# TeamCoin

TeamCoin is a blockchain-based contribution graph & allows people to answer questions about creative contributions like "Who did what where?", e.g. “Linus Torvalds created the Linux Kernel” or "Brian Chesky co-founded AirBnB in 2008".

## History

TeamCoin started out as SanCoin (website: sancoin.co) but was renamed to TeamCoin to avoid confusion with the SANtiment ICO.

## Code Architecture

Everything written in Solidity using OpenZeppelin libraries & with a copious amount of unit tests with Truffle.

##  Files
