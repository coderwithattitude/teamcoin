You will receive an offer by email with specific payment instructions and a unique BTC address.

Once payment has been confirmed you will be asked to provide the ETH address where you would like to receive your TeamCoin.

DO NOT USE EXCHANGES such as Coinbase. Verify that your ETH wallet can hold custom coins. When in doubt, ask!

After we have confirmed correctness of payment and ETH address you will receive an IOU Certificate.

We will use these certificates to assign the correct amount of pre-sale coins once the ICO is finished.

## IOU Example
